## Assigments

This repo contains my homework assignments when I took MTH 483 at Oregon State University. This course was offered Spring 2019 and taught by Dr. Tuan Pham. There were 8 homework assignments, all written in LaTeX. A number of the assignments included Mathematica code, but I unforunately did not have the forethought to save these files anywhere

## Final Grade

I received an A in this course.
